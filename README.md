I Made this mini project on kitchen equipment sales data from 48 different states of US during 2019 to 2022.
Texas seems to have more sales. Both in-store and online sales analysis can also be analysed for various states for the respective years.
I used a donut chart to show the online ond in-store sales. Horizontal bar chart for showing the sales of different equipments. And line graph to show the trend in sales from 2019 to 2022.
A  map chart is also used here to show the sales in different regions.
